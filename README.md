# Robotic-Tic-Tac-Toe-ESP32 
Tic tac toe robotic arm that uses ESP32, implementing vision, motor control and PID 

This project consists of a robotic arm capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe 
by automatically picking up and placing pieces on a physical board. 

# Features 
- Direct and inverse cinematic of the robot to know the positions on the board.
- Webcam used for vision.
- 3 DC motors with quadrature encoders.
- PID based motor control.
- Automated collection and placement using electromagnet.
- Positioning based on angular movement (degrees to pulses).
- Programmed using ESP32, Matlab the Arduino framework.

# Technologies
- ESP32
- C / C++
- Matlab
- Webcam
- Encoders
- H-briges
- PWM control

# What I learned 
- Camera vision using Matlab.
- Closed circuit motor control via PID.
- Encoder feedback processing.
- Sequencing and synchronization of movement.
- Debugging of integrated systems in real time.

This project was developed as part of my bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering.
